		<h2>Big Bang Theory</h2>
		<img src="img/big+bang4.jpg" width="250px">
		<p>
		Big Bang Theory is one of my favorite shows. <br>This show is about these physicist, Leonard and Sheldon, whose lives are all changed once Penny<br> moves in across the hall to their apartment. <br>This is show is funny, and each of the characters have a special role in the series. 
		</p>

		<h2>Flash</h2>
		<img src="img/flash.jpg"width="200px">
		<p>
		Flash is also my favorite show. <br>This show involves a guy who saves other people's lives with his super natural power (speed). <br>He uses his power to find out who killed his mother when he was younger. I started this show 2 days ago and I finished<br> watching the first season! I would defenitely reccommend this show if you are looking for something new to watch.

		<h3> Grey's Anatomy</h3>
		<img src="img/grey.jpg"width="300px">
		<p>Grey's Ananotmy is a medical tevevision series in which each of the characters try to <br>save others' lives while keeping their personal lives balanced as well. <br> Christina Yang is my favorite character in the show. She is humorous yet intelligent which makes you fall in love with her character.  </p>
