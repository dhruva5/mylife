			<h2>Sinster</h2>

			<p> This movie is about a man who hasn't made a best seller book in many years.<br> To get closer to an idea to his next book, he moves into a victim's home<br> and soon he realizes there is a supernatural force in the house.<br> This movie is one of my all time favorite horror movies because of it's interesting plot line. <br> This movie has a plot line that is very "realistic" and humanly which is one of the reasons why it is scary.  </p>

			<h2> Drag Me To Hell </h2>

			<p>The movie starts off when Christine Brown denies a woman to a home extension loan.<br />The woman get furious because her life is falling apart and decides to puts a cruse on<br> Christine and turns her life into actual hell. Every scene in the movie is entertaining and there<br> are endless amount of jump scares.This movie is intriguing and disturbing movie at the same time. <br>I would reccomend this movie if you are up for a challenge.

 			<p> A mother of twins move into a new house to escape her abusive husband. Dylan, <br>one of the twins, starts to get visits from the ghost. The ghost's <br>objective is to possess innocent children in order to make them kill their family. I thought, <br>it was well scripted because they structured the movie in a very realistic way.<br> The fact that they had twins play the roles of Dylan and Zach made it even more worse.
