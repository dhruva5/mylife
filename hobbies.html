		<h2>Running</h2>
		<img src="img/running.jpg" width="300px">
		<p> Running is one of my favorite hobbies since I did track in 7th and 8th grade.<br>I love the tension you get right before a race starts and I love the pain <br>you feel after a hard workout. Running makes me be more focused and it helps me stay relaxed.</p>
		<h3>Watching TV</h3>

		<img src="img/tv.jpg" width="300px">
		<p> Watching TV after a long day is the best thing in the world. <br> My favorite shows are Big Bang Theory, Grey's Anantomy, and The Flash.<br> I usually watch TV as soon as I get home from school to clear<br> my mind from all the chaos. It's a great way to de-stress your mind after a long day of work. </p>
		<h4>Reading</h4>
		<img src="img/reading.jpg"width="300px">
		<p> Reading is the best way to get lost in your thoughts. <br>It not only is good for you on an academic level, however it causes you think more <br>creative. It makes your thoughts grow and help <br>you interpret images/concepts better. It is peaceful yet wild at the same time.</p>
